# TriangleCenters
Orthocenter, Circumcenter, and Centroid calculator. No incenter because I'm too dumb.

Orthocenter - intersection of all three altitudes
Altitude - line that passes through one vertex of the triangle and is perpendicular to the opposite side

Circumcenter - intersection of all three perpendicular bisectors of the triangle sides

Centroid - intersection of all three medians
Median - line that passes through one vertex of the triangle and the midpoint of the opposite side
